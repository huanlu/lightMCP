# Memory Log

## Current Task Context
- **Date**: July 5, 2025
- **Project**: LIFX MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server
- **Workspace**: /Users/huanlu/Developer/lightMCP

## Project Overview
This is a LIFX smart light control project that implements an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to manage LIFX lights through Claude Desktop integration.

## Recent Activities
1. **File Analysis (July 5, 2025)**
   - Analyzed unstaged files in the project
   - Identified temporary/demo files that can be removed
   - Identified essential files to keep
   - Found security concern: `claude_desktop_config.json` contains actual LIFX token

## Files to Remove (User Request)
The following temporary files were identified for removal:
- `MCP_vs_VSCode.md` - Educational content, not needed for project
- `change-color.js` - Simple test script, temporary
- `mcp-flow-demo.js` - Educational demo, temporary
- `test-mcp-tool.js` - Testing script, temporary
- `test.js` - Basic test, temporary

## Files to Keep
Essential project files:
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive project documentation
- `setup.sh` - Automated setup script
- `test-api.js` - LIFX API connection test script
- `src/index.ts` - Main MCP server implementation

## Security Notes
- `claude_desktop_config.json` contains real LIFX token: `cb834050845b814bc01eb5e2893875dfeb6545b1a5dff9e24805c496f7d327e5`
- This file should be added to `.gitignore` or have the token removed/templated

## Next Steps
- [ ] Remove temporary files as requested by user
- [ ] Consider securing the configuration file with real token
- [ ] Create proper `.gitignore` if needed
